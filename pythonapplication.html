	<h1 style="font-size:70px;"> Python Application</h1>

		<p> During the first semester at the university I worked on this Python application. tHE FOCUS WAS TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION THAT would generate a series of numbers provided by the user input, and with that user input the result is different every time. That is why it's called like a Calculator, where the user can provide different number every time the code is runed, and still the application would given a non-hard-coded values. </p>

<hr>

<p>Here is a list of images showing the whole code of this application. </p>

<ul>
			<li>The following code is included in this application starting with this list</li>

<img src="p1.jpg" style="width:1200px;height:800px;">

<p>as you can see it included mylif file which is reponsilbr for calling the function of a certain calculation like addition or subtraction for example.</p>

<hr>

			<li>Here is a full list of images starting with the code of def functions</li>

<img src="p2.jpg" style="width:1200px;height:800px;">

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc1.com/viewc1.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 1.</a></p>


<p> as you can see the comment lines are represented by a pound sign: # </p>
<hr>

<br>




			<li>The Start of the application as you can see is with the input method, this will allow the user to put in any random number</li>

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc1.com/viewc1.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 2.</a></p>


<hr>

	<h88>Once we have the first and second number the we want the code to continue with our answer so the code shows the list of choices in the menu:</h88>

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc3.com/viewc3.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 3 and 4</a></p>

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc4.com/viewc4.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 5 and 6</a></p>

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc5.com/viewc5.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 7 and 8</a></p>

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc6.com/viewc6.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 9, 10 and 20 </a></p>



<br>



<p>and the following loop once again...</p>

<img src="p23.jpg" style="width:1200px;height:800px;">

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc7.com/viewc7.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 11</a></p>



<br>

<p> we need these choices so we can call upon that choice and print a statement which is the calculation like addition, subtraction, mult.</p>
<br>
<p> as you see we call this a loop because we want the choices to repeat itself, until the calculation is completed, and all the choices are checked upon by the user, so like choice 1 and choice 2,etc.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<li>Our calculation have each a variable. These variables represent a different type of calculation. Multiplication, division, addition.</li>

<p><a href="https://mugdass.github.io/viewc7.com/viewc7.html" class="button" >Click here to see the image 12</a></p>

<p> as you see in this part of the code, the def functions () mentioned earlier will use these variables and (t) values, to calculate for the result.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h111> We have developed Classes and used certain function to perform same calculation like addition, subtractions, but why this makes it easier, is because when that class is referenced, the function can be used to call upon that calculation like in this photo: </h111>

<li>The above example showcases how the words called Strings in programming language can be joined together with the joining method.</li>

<p> I was given the task to create a menu when a one of the choices is selected that calculation is performed, this is why def function and class declaration is very important.</p>

<br>
<hr>

<br>

<p>as I mentioned earlier that def function are very important for performing those calculation when the user input choice is selected. Likewise in the code image below you can ca see the list of action that will be performed when these functions like def res() will be called to print.</p>

<h09>This piece of code shows a text that was generated with the use of file handling in Python, what it does as you can see is it generates the result with the given random numbers by the user input.</h09>

<img src="p24.jpg" style="width:1200px;height:800px;">
<br>
<p>Likewise it creates a file that displays the result of those given numbers by the user.</p>
